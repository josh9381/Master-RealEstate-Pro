## Notes

### Technical Decisions
- **Card Components:** Using existing ui/card components
- **Icons:** Lucide React (already installed)
- **Charts:** Recharts (already installed)
- **Mock Data:** Centralized in `src/data/mockData.ts`
- **Navigation:** React Router `useNavigate` hook

### Design Patterns
Each enhanced page follows this structure:
1. Header with title + actions (Refresh, Filter, Export)
2. Quick Actions row (common tasks)
3. Main Stats cards with progress
4. Charts section (2-6 charts)
5. Data tables/lists
6. Activity feed or timeline
7. Alerts or notifications

This pattern suggests building a **PageLayout** component in future phases.
