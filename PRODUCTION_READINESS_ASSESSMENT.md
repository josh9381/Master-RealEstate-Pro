## üéØ WHAT'S MISSING FOR PRODUCTION

- SSL certificate (automatic with Railway/Vercel)

**Time Estimate:** 1-2 days  
**Difficulty:** Easy (Railway has one-click deploy)  
**Cost:** $5-20/month initially

**Without This:** Nobody can access your app except you on localhost

---

#### 2. Email Verification & Password Reset ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL**

---

#### 3. Production Environment Configuration ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL**
**Status:** .env.example exists but no production .env  
**What's Needed:**
- Strong JWT secrets (not "dev_secret_change_in_production")

- Error logging to Sentry or similar
- Database connection pooling
- Environment-specific configs

**Time Estimate:** 4-6 hours
