## DECISION SESSIONS

**76 decision points batched into 15 focused sessions.** Instead of stopping 76 times, we resolve related decisions together in one conversation per session. Each session should be completed *before* the corresponding phase begins.

| Session | When | Decisions | Topics to Resolve |
|---------|------|-----------|-------------------|
| **DS-1** | ✅ RESOLVED | 6 | AI: split (prefs=user, scoring/training=admin). Rate limits: all 5 endpoints done. asyncHandler: skipped (Express 5 native). Dead code + upload cleanup: deferred to Phase 14. |
| **DS-2** | ✅ RESOLVED | 2 | Enum values for all String→enum conversions (10 fields) — all UPPERCASE convention. Data retention: RefreshToken=0d, PasswordResetToken=7d, LoginHistory=90d, AIInsight=30d |
| **DS-3** | ✅ RESOLVED | 4 | File upload: 10MB max, jpg/png/webp/gif. Integrations: all "Coming Soon" (no fake OAuth). Deliverability: contextual (campaign detail + email settings). Saved Reports: card grid with edit-in-place. |
| **DS-4** | ✅ RESOLVED | 5 | Pipeline default stages (8 stages incl. Nurturing), pipeline types (Buyer/Seller/Rental/Commercial/General + Custom), follow-up delivery channels (resolved in 3.1), call logging outcomes (resolved in 3.2), lead field columns (deferred) |
| **DS-5** | Before Phase 3B | 5 | Import duplicate criteria, relationship types, lead assignment strategy, real-estate-specific fields, deduplication behavior |
| **DS-6** | ✅ RESOLVED | 5 | Editor: block-based + MJML (not WYSIWYG — clean HTML). Send-time: timezone + historical engagement. Conditions: all 4 (lead field, email opened, link clicked, time elapsed). Delay: minutes/hours/days/weeks + specific date/time. Retry: 1–3 retries, exponential backoff, notify user on failure (no silent skip). |
| **DS-7** | ✅ RESOLVED | 4 | Attribution: all 5 models (first-touch, last-touch, linear, time-decay, U-shaped). Scheduling: Daily/Weekly/Biweekly/Monthly/Quarterly/Yearly/Custom(N days), email PDF + in-app history. Goals: 7 metrics (leads, deals, revenue, conversion, calls, appointments, response time) + custom. Recurrence: same 7 patterns as scheduling. |
| **DS-8** | ✅ RESOLVED | 1 | Terms of Service: placeholder page at /terms-of-service, consent checkbox on registration |
| **DS-9** | ✅ RESOLVED | 3 | AI models: existing 6 tiers (gpt-5.1/5-mini/5-nano/5.2/5.2-pro/4o-mini). Personalization: system prompt + tone (6) + industry (8) + max tokens. Budget: $25 warning / $50 caution / $100 hard limit (adjustable). |
| **DS-10** | ✅ RESOLVED | 4 | Dialer/recording/voicemail: deferred (need Twilio Voice decisions). Document attachments: PDF, images, Office docs, 10MB, 20/lead. Cold Call Hub: smart queue + disposition + stats. |
| **DS-11** | ✅ RESOLVED | 13 | Help pages: wired HelpCenter search, real support tickets, video tutorials "Coming Soon", real documentation. Billing: merged 4-tab BillingPage. Pricing: 5 tiers (STARTER $49 → ENTERPRISE). Proration: Stripe `create_prorations`. Usage metering: hard caps via `enforcePlanLimit` middleware. Settings ownership + stub routes: deferred to Phase 10. |
| **DS-12** | ✅ RESOLVED | 9 | IntegrationsHub: keep "Coming Soon" labels. 501 stubs: leave in place. APIIntegrationsPage: implement real API key management. SocialMediaDashboard: rebuild with real UI + "Coming Soon" banner. ComplianceSettings: deferred — discuss when we reach it. Route redirects: all 3 confirmed. Campaign reports: merge into tabbed page. AI analytics: keep separate pages, add AIAnalytics to sidebar. Campaign types: merge into filter tabs on CampaignsList. |
| **DS-11B** | ✅ RESOLVED | 16 | ConfirmDialog: modal overlay, contextual labels, red destructive buttons, fade+scale animation. Breadcrumbs: below header, collapse 4+ depth, chevron separator, home icon. Page titles: `RealEstate Pro — Page Name`, generic labels, unread count in tab. WebSocket: silent reconnect, fetch missed notifications. Events: all 9 types, silent background refresh. Search: 300ms debounce, min 2 chars. Toasts: max 5, animated slide-out. Export: CSV+PDF, branded, all data. Voicemail: disabled+tooltip. Templates: 4-tier (System→Org→Team→Personal), categories, {{variables}} site-wide. Shortcuts: remove all system-wide. Sidebar nav: no new items — embed Calendar/Tasks/Activity widgets on Dashboard. Campaign chart: replace with pipeline funnel, move opens/clicks to Campaign Reports. Chunk errors: 3 silent retries then error card. |
| **DS-13** | ✅ RESOLVED | 12 | .md files: single timeline doc (`DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md`). Root scripts: keep `start-dev.sh`+`stop-dev.sh`, delete 13 test scripts + fix-frontend-enums.sh + 2 logs. Backend scripts: delete all 41 ad-hoc. Compiled .js tests: delete all 14. Mock data: delete `mockData.ts`+`mockData.config.ts`+`MockModeBanner.tsx`, keep `AnalyticsEmptyState.tsx`. Logger: custom thin wrapper `src/lib/logger.ts` (silent prod, logs dev). Unused deps: delete all 8 (redis, node-fetch, nodemon, reactflow, framer-motion, zod, @hookform/resolvers, react-hook-form). Misplaced deps: move `@types/multer`+`typescript` to devDeps, keep `@types/helmet`. Zod mismatch: moot (frontend zod removed). Dev pages: keep `DatabaseMaintenance`+`FeatureFlags`, delete `DemoDataGenerator`+`DebugConsole`+`RetryQueue`. Prisma backups: delete all 3. Build artifacts: remove from git tracking. |
| **DS-14** | ✅ PARTIALLY RESOLVED | 2 | Redis client consolidation: already ioredis-only (redis pkg removed in Phase 12 DS-13). Mobile nav items: deferred to Phase 14. |
| **DS-15** | ✅ RESOLVED | 4 | Onboarding tour: full site walkthrough covering every major section (Dashboard, Leads, Campaigns, Communication, Workflows, AI Hub, Analytics, Settings) with key actions highlighted. Notification sounds: ON by default, per-event granular settings so users toggle sound on/off for each notification type individually. Coming Soon pages: illustration + blurred preview hybrid — greyed/blurred mockup of upcoming feature with polished illustration, description, and optional "Notify me". CI/CD: Lint + TypeScript type-check + Build on every push/PR; E2E (Playwright) on PRs to main only. |

> **How this works:** Before starting each phase, we hold the corresponding Decision Session. All ⚠️ items for that phase are resolved in one conversation. This eliminates start-stop friction and lets you make coherent, related decisions together.

## PHASE 0: CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES (Days 1–2) ✅ COMPLETE
*Fix anything that would be a production vulnerability or crash.*

> **Gate check:** Both `npm run build` (frontend) and `cd backend && npm run build` (backend) pass clean.
> **DS-1 Decisions Resolved:**
> - **0.7 (AI route auth):** Split — preferences per-user, scoring-config/training/recalibrate admin-only
> - **0.10+0.14 (Rate limits):** All 5 endpoints covered: messageSend (30/15min), passwordChange (5/15min), workflowTrigger (20/15min), unsubscribe (30/15min), teamInvite (10/hr)
> - **0.11 (asyncHandler):** Skipped — Express 5 handles async errors natively
> - **0.15+0.22 (Dead code + upload cleanup):** Deferred to Phase 14 (codebase hygiene)

| # | Task | Time | Status |

| 0.30 | **MEDIUM**: Protected `/api/system/integration-status` with `authenticate` middleware | 10 min | ✅ |
| 0.31 | **MEDIUM**: `useAIAvailability` hook switched from raw `fetch` to authenticated `api.get()` | 15 min | ✅ |

### New Files Created in Phase 0
| File | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| `backend/src/utils/distributedLock.ts` | Redis SETNX-based distributed lock for cron jobs |
| `backend/src/validators/ai.validator.ts` | 16 Zod schemas for AI POST/PUT endpoints |
| `backend/src/validators/notification.validator.ts` | Zod schemas for notification routes |
| `backend/src/validators/admin.validator.ts` | Zod schemas for admin system-settings + maintenance |
| `backend/src/validators/segmentation.validator.ts` | Zod schemas for segmentation routes |
| `backend/src/validators/savedReport.validator.ts` | Zod schemas for saved report routes |
| `src/components/auth/RequireRole.tsx` | Frontend role guard (`RequireRole` + `RequireAdmin`) |
| `src/lib/userStorage.ts` | User-scoped localStorage helpers (prefixed with userId) |

### Bugs Found & Fixed During Phase 0
- **Feature flags key mismatch:** `clearAuth()` removed `'feature-flags'` but actual key was `'crm_feature_flags'` — fixed by `clearUserStorage()` using canonical key list
- **Zod 4 API change:** `z.record()` requires both key and value schemas in Zod 4.x (project uses 4.1.12) — fixed in `ai.validator.ts`

---

## PHASE 1: DATA & SCHEMA INTEGRITY (Days 2–3) ✅ COMPLETE
*Fix the data layer before building features on top of it.*

> **DS-2 Decisions Resolved:**
> - **1.5 (Enum values):** All 10 String→enum conversions decided and implemented (see enum list below)
> - **1.7 (Retention periods):** RefreshToken=0 days after expiry, PasswordResetToken=7 days, LoginHistory=90 days (inactive), AIInsight=30 days after expiry/dismissal
> - **1.8 (Team vs Org):** Organization is authoritative for access control and billing. Team.subscriptionTier is an orphaned cache — full cleanup deferred to Phase 9.

| # | Task | Time | Status |
|---|------|------|--------|
| 1.1 | **HIGH**: Add `organizationId` to `Note` model for multi-tenant isolation | 1 hr | ✅ |
| 1.1b | **HIGH**: Add `organizationId` to 7 additional models missing org-level scoping: `BusinessSettings`, `EmailConfig`, `Integration`, `SMSConfig`, `NotificationSettings`, `APIKeyAudit`, `PasswordResetToken` — ties into 9.9 ownership decision | 2 hr | ✅ |
| 1.2 | Add `@relation` + `onDelete: Cascade` to `RefreshToken.organizationId` | 30 min | ✅ |
| 1.3 | Add `@relation` to `WorkflowExecution.leadId` (with `onDelete: SetNull`) | 30 min | ✅ |
| 1.4 | Add `organizationId` to `ABTestResult` model | 30 min | ✅ |
| 1.4b | Add `onDelete: SetNull` to `Lead.assignedToId` → `User` relation — currently no `onDelete` specified, deleting a User causes Prisma error | 20 min | ✅ |
| 1.5 | ~~⚠️~~ Convert inconsistent String status fields to enums: `CustomFieldDefinition.type`, `Notification.type`, `Integration.syncStatus`, `Segment.matchType`, `Message.bounceType`, `CampaignLead.status`, `Call.status`, `Call.direction`, `AIInsight.type`, `AIInsight.priority` — **All 10 enum types created, all backend code updated** | 2 hr | ✅ |
| 1.6 | Add composite indexes: `Notification(userId, read)`, `Message(organizationId, type)`, `LoginHistory(userId, isActive)` | 30 min | ✅ |
| 1.6b | Add additional indexes: `RefreshToken(expiresAt)`, `PasswordResetToken(expiresAt)`, `WorkflowExecution(leadId)`, `LoginHistory(createdAt)`, `Note(createdAt)` — needed for cleanup crons and chronological queries | 30 min | ✅ |
| 1.7 | ~~⚠️~~ Add stale data cleanup cron jobs: prune expired `RefreshToken`, `PasswordResetToken`, `LoginHistory`, `AIInsight` — **Hourly cron with distributed locking** | 2 hr | ✅ |
| 1.8 | Clarify `Team` vs `Organization` model ownership — Organization is authoritative. Full cleanup deferred to Phase 9. | 1 hr | ✅ |

**Phase Total: ~11 hours (1.5 days) — ✅ COMPLETE**

### New Files Created in Phase 1
| File | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| `backend/src/jobs/dataCleanup.ts` | Hourly stale data cleanup cron with distributed locking (RefreshToken, PasswordResetToken, LoginHistory, AIInsight) |
| `backend/prisma/phase1-data-migration.sql` | Raw SQL migration for data backfill and String→enum type conversions |

### New Enums Created in Phase 1

| `BounceType` | HARD, SOFT, COMPLAINT, UNKNOWN |
| `IntegrationSyncStatus` | IDLE, SYNCING, SYNCED, CONNECTED, DISCONNECTED, FAILED |
| `SegmentMatchType` | ALL, ANY |
| `CampaignLeadStatus` | PENDING, SENT, DELIVERED, OPENED, CLICKED, BOUNCED, UNSUBSCRIBED, CONVERTED |

## PHASE 10: FIX BROKEN PAGES + CONSOLIDATION (Days 37–39)
*Now that everything is built, fix dishonest pages and consolidate overlapping features.*

> **DS-12 Decisions Resolved:**
> - **10.1 (IntegrationsHub):** Keep "Coming Soon" labels — already honest from Phase 2, no changes needed.
> - **10.4 (SecuritySettings):** Already wired to real API in Phase 6 (task 6.7) — sessions, revocation, terminate-all, 2FA all working.
> - **10.6 (501 stubs):** Leave 501 stubs in place — they serve as clear documentation of what's not yet built.
> - **10.6b (APIIntegrationsPage):** Implement real API key management — generate/revoke keys, store hashed in DB, audit log, masked display with copy-to-clipboard.
> - **10.6e (SocialMediaDashboard):** Rebuild with real UI framework + "Coming Soon" banner — proper layout/components ready for API wiring later.
> - **10.6f (ComplianceSettings):** Deferred — stop and discuss when we reach this task. Compliance too important to rush.
> - **10.7 (Route redirects):** All 3 confirmed: `/analytics/report-builder` → `/analytics/custom-reports`, `/communication` → `/communication/inbox`, `/settings/team` → `/admin/team`.
> - **10.8 (Campaign reports):** Merge CampaignReports + CampaignAnalytics into one tabbed page ("Overview" + "Detailed Reports").
> - **10.9 (AI analytics):** Keep as separate pages (AIAnalytics=technical metrics, IntelligenceInsights=business intelligence, PredictiveAnalytics=forecasts). Fix: add AIAnalytics (`/ai/analytics`) to sidebar sub-menu.
> - **10.10 (Campaign types):** Merge EmailCampaigns/SMSCampaigns/PhoneCampaigns into filter tabs on CampaignsList ("All | Email | SMS | Phone"). Preserve type-specific UI. Old URLs redirect to `/campaigns?type=email` etc.

### 10A: Fix Broken/Fake Pages

| # | Task | Time | Status |
|---|------|------|--------|
| 10.1 | ~~⚠️~~ **Integrations Hub** — **DECIDED:** Keep "Coming Soon" labels (already done in Phase 2, task 2.5). Verified: disabled buttons, honest status, no fake OAuth. | 0 min | ✅ |
| 10.2 | Fix CampaignsList error swallowing — removed `catch { return null }`, now throws error + added `isError` state with error UI | 30 min | ✅ |
| 10.3 | Fix 38+ silent `catch {}` blocks — added `console.error` to 38 catch blocks across 24 frontend + 14 backend files. Left 22 intentionally-silent catches (JSON parsing, cross-origin, date utilities, sessionStorage, JWT decode). | 3 hr | ✅ |
| 10.4 | ~~⚠️~~ SecuritySettings — **Already done in Phase 6** (task 6.7). Verified: real `authApi.getSessions()`, session revocation, terminate-all, 2FA setup — all wired to real API. | 0 min | ✅ |
| 10.5 | Replace all hardcoded placeholder URLs (`crm.yourcompany.com`, `Your Company Name` in InvoiceDetail, `user@example.com` in Sidebar/Header, `https://api.masterrealestatepro.com/v1` in APIIntegrationsPage, etc.) with config-driven values — created `src/lib/appConfig.ts`, updated 7 files | 1 hr | ✅ |
| 10.6 | ~~⚠️~~ Stub 501 backend routes — **DECIDED:** Leave 501 stubs in place (clear documentation of unbuilt features, obvious vs. silent failure) | 0 min | ✅ |
| 10.6b | ~~⚠️~~ **APIIntegrationsPage** — **DECIDED:** Implemented real API key management — `APIKey` Prisma model with SHA-256 hashed keys, generate/revoke/list endpoints, audit logging, masked display with copy-to-clipboard, removed all fake data | 4 hr | ✅ |

| 10.6e | ~~⚠️~~ **SocialMediaDashboard** — **DECIDED:** Rebuilt with real UI framework + "Coming Soon" banner. Removed fake API calls/state/hardcoded data. Clean layout with platform cards (features list, disabled Connect), planned features grid, placeholder dashboard preview. Ready for API wiring when platforms are connected. | 2 hr | ✅ |
| 10.6f | ~~⚠️~~ **ComplianceSettings** — **DECIDED:** Deferred — stop and discuss when we reach this task. Compliance too important to rush. | 0 min | ⏭️ |

### 10B: Consolidate Overlapping Pages

| # | Task | Time | Status |
|---|------|------|--------|

Also updated Sidebar to link directly to `/communication/inbox`. | 30 min | ✅ |
| 10.8 | ~~⚠️~~ Merge `CampaignReports` + `CampaignAnalytics` into 1 tabbed page — **DONE:** "Overview" tab (analytics API — performance trend, comparison table, best times, top content) + "Detailed Reports" tab (campaign list — stat cards, per-campaign detail cards, funnel, leaderboards). One URL `/campaigns/reports`. `/analytics/campaigns` redirects. Removed `CampaignAnalytics` lazy import. | 2 hr | ✅ |

| 10.10 | ~~⚠️~~ Campaign type pages → filter tabs — **DONE:** Merged EmailCampaigns/SMSCampaigns/PhoneCampaigns into "All | Email | SMS | Phone" type filter tabs on CampaignsList. Added `typeFilter` state driven by `?type=` URL search params. Phone tab shows Coming Soon banner. CampaignsSubNav updated to use query params. Old URLs (`/campaigns/email`, `/campaigns/sms`, `/campaigns/phone`) redirect via `<Navigate>`. Removed 3 lazy imports from App.tsx. | 3 hr | ✅ |

| # | Task | Time | Status |
|---|------|------|--------|
| 11.1 | Fix dark mode + sidebar persistence — added Zustand `persist` middleware to `uiStore.ts`, persists `theme` and `sidebarOpen` to localStorage key `ui-preferences`, `onRehydrateStorage` applies dark class on page load | 15 min | ✅ |
| 11.2 | Fix sidebar state persistence (collapsed/expanded) — **covered by 11.1** (same `persist` middleware, `sidebarOpen` included in `partialize`) | 15 min | ✅ |
| 11.3 | Replace 21 `window.confirm()` dialogs across 19 files with a reusable styled `ConfirmDialog` component — created `confirmStore.ts` Zustand store, `ConfirmDialog.tsx` component (uses existing Dialog), `useConfirm` hook. Replaced all 21 bare `confirm()`/`window.confirm()` calls across 19 files with async `showConfirm()` — contextual titles, destructive variant with red button, fade+scale animation | 2.5 hr | ✅ |
| 11.4 | Add breadcrumb navigation — created `Breadcrumbs.tsx` component in layout. Below header, Home icon first, chevron `›` separators, auto-generates from URL path with label map, collapses middle segments at 4+ depth, hidden on Dashboard | 2 hr | ✅ |
| 11.5 | Add page title management — created `usePageTitle` hook. Format: `(N) RealEstate Pro — Page Name`. 80+ route-to-title mappings, unread notification count from API (60s polling via react-query), dynamic ID routes show "Detail" suffix | 1.5 hr | ✅ |
| 11.6 | Fix WebSocket connection — **DECIDED:** silent auto-reconnect, fetch missed notifications on reconnect. Upgraded to infinite reconnect attempts (was 10), max delay 30s (was 10s), token refresh on reconnect. Added `onReconnect` callback registry. On reconnect, `useRealtimeUpdates` silently invalidates all active query caches (notifications, leads, tasks, appointments, campaigns, workflows, messages). | 1.5 hr | ✅ |
| 11.7 | Wire frontend to consume WebSocket events — **DECIDED:** all 9 event types complete. Added 3 new backend emit helpers (`pushTaskUpdate`, `pushCallUpdate`, `pushReminderDue`) to `socket.ts`. Added emit calls in `task.controller.ts` (create/update/delete/complete), `call.controller.ts` (logCall), `reminderProcessor.ts` (due reminders). Frontend `useRealtimeUpdates` now handles `task:update`, `call:update`, `reminder:due` events with appropriate query invalidation. | 2 hr | ✅ |

| 11.9 | Add search debounce to `GlobalSearchModal` — **DECIDED:** 300ms delay, min 2 characters. Added `debouncedQuery` state with 300ms setTimeout, queries only fire when debounced query has 2+ chars, static page filtering uses raw query for instant local results, empty state shows "Type at least 2 characters" hint | 30 min | ✅ |
| 11.10 | Add toast maximum limit — **DECIDED:** max 5 visible, oldest slides out with animation. Added `MAX_TOASTS=5` constant, `exiting` flag on Toast interface, overflow eviction marks oldest as exiting (300ms slide-out animation via `translate-x-full` + `opacity-0` transition), auto-remove also uses exit animation, `removeToast` animated | 20 min | ✅ |
| 11.11 | Fix Dashboard export — **DECIDED:** CSV + PDF dropdown, branded PDF styling, all dashboard data included. Replaced single JSON export with dropdown menu (CSV/PDF). CSV includes all dashboard sections (stats, quick stats, pipeline, campaigns, revenue, activities, tasks) with proper escaping. PDF uses jsPDF with branded header (blue logo text, date, range), structured sections, auto-pagination, page numbering footer. Both formats include complete dashboard data. | 2 hr | ✅ |
| 11.12 | Fix CallCenter voicemail button — **DECIDED:** disabled button with "Coming Soon" tooltip, grey styling, small "Coming Soon" label below button text (real voicemail deferred to Phase 17 with Twilio Voice) | 30 min | ✅ |
| 11.13 | Move Inbox templates/quick replies to API — **DECIDED:** 4-tier hierarchy (System → Organization → Team → Personal), organized by categories, `{{variable}}` placeholder support standardized site-wide. Created `MessageTemplate` Prisma model with `MessageTemplateTier` enum, backend CRUD controller + routes at `/api/message-templates`, seed-defaults endpoint auto-populates 8 message templates + 6 quick replies on first load. Frontend fetches via react-query with fallback arrays, auto-seeds on empty. | 3 hr | ✅ |
| 11.14 | Remove all keyboard shortcuts system-wide — **DECIDED:** stripped all shortcut listeners. Removed `?` key handler + `KeyboardShortcutsModal` from MainLayout, removed `Cmd+K` search shortcut + `⌘K` kbd badge from Header, removed 7 inbox shortcuts (mark read/unread, archive, star, bulk select, delete, mark all read) from CommunicationInbox. `KeyboardShortcutsModal.tsx` file left in place (orphaned, no imports). | 1 hr | ✅ |
| 11.15 | Fix setTimeout memory leaks in `CommunicationInbox` (6 leaks), `LeadScoring`, `WorkflowBuilder`, `Login`, `Register` — added `useRef` + `useEffect` cleanup for all timer refs across all 5 files: CommunicationInbox (timersRef array for 6 timers), Login (navTimerRef for 2 timers), Register (navTimerRef), WorkflowBuilder (deleteConfirmTimerRef), LeadScoring (recalcTimerRef) | 1 hr | ✅ |
| 11.16 | Embed Calendar, Tasks, Activity widgets on Dashboard — **DECIDED:** no new sidebar items, add widgets with "View full" links, Integrations stays under Settings. Added `appointmentsApi.getUpcoming` query, Upcoming Appointments card with loading/error/empty states, appointment type badges, lead names, clickable rows navigate to /calendar. Grid upgraded to 3-column layout (Activity + Tasks + Calendar). | 2 hr | ✅ |
| 11.17 | Replace Dashboard campaign chart with pipeline funnel — **DECIDED:** remove opens/clicks chart, add pipeline funnel mini-chart (leads per stage), ensure opens/clicks data on Campaign Reports page. Conversion Funnel section with horizontal bar chart, overall conversion rate, help tooltip. | 1.5 hr | ✅ |
| 11.18 | Add chunk load error handling — **DECIDED:** silent auto-retry 3 times, then clean error card with "Reload page" button.

## PHASE 12: CODEBASE HYGIENE (Days 39–40)
*Moved to end per philosophy: build first, clean up last.*

> **DS-13 Decisions Resolved:**
> - **12.1 (.md grouping):** Single timeline doc — merge all 144 into `DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md` with sections
> - **12.2 (Root scripts):** Keep `start-dev.sh` + `stop-dev.sh`, delete 13 test scripts + `fix-frontend-enums.sh` + 2 log files
> - **12.3 (Backend scripts):** Delete all 41 ad-hoc scripts (keep `jest.config.js` + `jest.config.regression.js`)
> - **12.4 (Compiled tests):** Delete all 14 `.js` duplicates in `backend/tests/`
> - **12.5 (Mock data):** Delete `mockData.ts` + `mockData.config.ts` + `MockModeBanner.tsx`. Keep `AnalyticsEmptyState.tsx` (real UI component)
> - **12.6 (Logger):** Custom thin wrapper `src/lib/logger.ts` — silent in prod, logs in dev, zero dependencies
> - **12.7 (Unused deps):** Delete all 8 confirmed unused (redis, node-fetch, nodemon, reactflow, framer-motion, zod, @hookform/resolvers, react-hook-form)
> - **12.8 (Misplaced deps):** Move `@types/multer` + `typescript` to devDeps. Keep `@types/helmet` (helmet is used in server.ts)
> - **12.10 (Build artifacts):** Remove from git tracking (playwright-report, test-results, e2e/screenshots, e2e/e2e/screenshots)
> - **12.13 (Zod mismatch):** Moot — frontend `zod` removed in 12.7
> - **12.14 (Dev pages):** Keep `DatabaseMaintenance` + `FeatureFlags` (real admin tools). Delete `DemoDataGenerator`, `DebugConsole`, `RetryQueue` (fake/mock)
> - **12.15 (Prisma backups):** Delete all 3 backup files

| 13.4 | Extract inline business logic from route files → 4 new controllers: `billing.controller.ts` (5 handlers), `webhook.controller.ts` (6 handlers + 2 helpers, 892→26 lines in routes), `export.controller.ts`, `segmentation.controller.ts`. All route files rewritten as thin wrappers. | 2.5 hr | ✅ |

| 13.6 | Set up ESLint for backend (frontend already has it configured; backend has zero linting) | 1 hr | ✅ |
| 13.7 | Add pre-commit hooks with husky + lint-staged (lint + type-check on commit) | 1 hr | ✅ |

## ADDITIONAL FINDINGS

These were discovered during deep codebase analysis and are incorporated into the phases above:

| # | Finding | Severity | Phase |
|---|---------|----------|-------|
| A | **Token key mismatch** — `useSocket.ts` (3 occurrences), `NotificationBell.tsx`, `AIComposer.tsx`, `ContentGeneratorWizard.tsx` read `'token'` but auth stores as `'accessToken'`. WebSocket + AI streaming completely broken. | CRITICAL | 0.1 |
| B | **WebSocket JWT_SECRET vs JWT_ACCESS_SECRET** — socket.ts uses wrong env var, falls back to `'dev-secret'`. | CRITICAL | 0.2 |
| C | **`prisma/migrations/` gitignored** — migrations must be committed for reproducible deploys. | CRITICAL | 12.9 |
| D | **Webhook signature bypass** — when Twilio/SendGrid tokens aren't configured, verification is skipped. | HIGH | 0.3 |
| E | **Hardcoded encryption key fallback** — `'default-32-byte-key-change-this!'` if env var missing. | HIGH | 0.4 |
| F | **No uncaughtException/unhandledRejection handlers** — server crashes silently. | HIGH | 0.5 |
| G | **`package-lock.json` gitignored** — builds are non-reproducible. | HIGH | 12.9 |
| H | **`Note` model missing `organizationId`** — multi-tenant data isolation gap. | HIGH | 1.1 |
| I | **`$queryRawUnsafe`** in admin controller — 7 usages with string interpolation. | MEDIUM | 0.17 |
| J | **`asyncHandler` missing from 10 route files** — not 4 as originally estimated. | MEDIUM | 0.11 |
| K | **21 `window.confirm()` dialogs** across 19 files — not 3 as originally counted. | MEDIUM | 11.3 |
| L | **451 `console.*` statements** — not 92 as originally counted (342 BE + 109 FE). | MEDIUM | 12.6 |
| M | **Admin pages with no frontend role guard** — pages render for regular users. | MEDIUM | 0.16 |
| N | **localStorage not cleaned on logout** — settings leak between users. | MEDIUM | 0.19 |
| O | **localStorage keys not user-scoped** — user A's data shows for user B. | MEDIUM | 0.20 |
| P | **SystemSettings in-memory store** — lost on restart, no Prisma model. | MEDIUM | 9.1 |
| Q | **No stale data cleanup** — 4 tables with expirable data, no pruning cron. | MEDIUM | 1.7 |
| R | **Missing composite indexes** — 3+ high-frequency query patterns. | MEDIUM | 1.6 |
| S | **`/tmp/uploads` never cleaned** — disk exhaustion risk. | MEDIUM | 0.22 |
| T | **Backend `.env.example` missing ~16 vars**. | MEDIUM | 12.12 |
| U | **5 dev-only pages shipping to production** — DemoDataGenerator, DebugConsole, DatabaseMaintenance, RetryQueue, FeatureFlags. | MEDIUM | 12.14 |
| V | **Feature overload** — 84 pages / 91 routes (~4x competing CRMs). Consolidation in Phase 10B after features built. | DESIGN | 10B |
| W | **3 billing pages with significant overlap** — decision deferred. | DESIGN | 9.10 |
| X | **AI SSE streaming already implemented** — removed from plan (was 4 wasted hours). | INFO | — |
| Y | **HealthCheckDashboard already wired** to real API — removed from plan. | INFO | — |
| Z | **Newsletter already has "Coming Soon" banner** — removed from plan. | INFO | — |
| AA | **LoadingSkeleton component already exists** — just needs importing in 2 more files. | INFO | 11.8 |
| BB | **2FA backend fully implemented** (speakeasy) — only login flow gap remains. | INFO | 6.1 |
| CC | **Email opt-out infrastructure exists** — only SMS STOP keyword handling needed. | INFO | 4.4 |

### Additional Findings from v4 Full Codebase Audit (March 2, 2026)

| # | Finding | Severity | Phase |
|---|---------|----------|-------|
| DD | **No `express.raw()` for Stripe webhooks** — `express.json()` applied globally destroys raw body needed for Stripe signature verification. Webhooks can never verify. | CRITICAL | 0.23 |
| EE | **No graceful shutdown for Prisma/Redis** — open DB connections leak on restart. | HIGH | 0.24 |
| FF | **No distributed lock on campaign scheduler cron** — multiple instances = duplicate sends. | HIGH | 0.25 |
| GG | **Auth error messages leak JWT internals** — "jwt malformed", "invalid signature" sent to client. | HIGH | 0.26 |
| HH | **7 additional models missing `organizationId`** — `BusinessSettings`, `EmailConfig`, `Integration`, `SMSConfig`, `NotificationSettings`, `APIKeyAudit`, `PasswordResetToken`. Plan had only `Note`. | HIGH | 1.1b |

| UU | **Login "Remember me" does nothing** — checkbox exists with no effect. | MEDIUM | 6.6 |
| VV | **ForgotPassword/ResetPassword double-layout** — double centering/background. | LOW | 6.8 |
| WW | **Dual token storage sync issue** — Zustand persist + manual localStorage can desync. | MEDIUM | 6.9 |
| XX | **`useAIAvailability` hook bypasses auth** — uses raw `fetch()` instead of `api` axios instance. | MEDIUM | 0.31 |
| YY | **5 additional unused frontend deps** — `framer-motion`, `zod`, `@hookform/resolvers`, `react-hook-form`. Plan had only `reactflow`. | MEDIUM | 12.7 |
| ZZ | **No CI/CD pipeline** — no `.github/` directory, no automated tests on push/PR. | CRITICAL | 16.1 |
| AAA | **No Dockerfile or deployment config** — cannot deploy to production. | CRITICAL | 16.2-16.4 |
| BBB | **No README.md** — root has zero README despite 144 .md files. | HIGH | 12.19 |
| CCC | **Hardcoded Twilio/OpenAI/email fallback values** — `'+1234567890'`, `'placeholder-will-use-org-key'`, `'noreply@realestate.com'`. | MEDIUM | 0.27-0.29 |
| DDD | **`/api/system/integration-status` unauthenticated** — leaks service configuration status. | MEDIUM | 0.30 |
| EEE | **No `.prettierrc` config** — Prettier set as formatter but no config file. | LOW | 12.17 |
| FFF | **`.devcontainer` Node version stale** — specifies Node 18/20 but runtime is Node 22. | LOW | 12.18 |
| GGG | **`start-dev.sh` hardcoded Codespace URL** — won't work in different environments. | LOW | 12.16 |

| NNN | **Email template settings in localStorage** — lost across devices. | MEDIUM | 10.6d |

### Additional Findings from v5 Cross-Audit (March 2, 2026)

| # | Finding | Severity | Phase |
|---|---------|----------|-------|
| OOO | **No production build verification** — `npm run build` never validated; the build may fail due to type errors, unused imports, Zod mismatches. | HIGH | 0.0 |
| PPP | **Express 5 makes `asyncHandler` potentially redundant** — Express 5.1.0 auto-catches async errors; plan allocates 2 hours for asyncHandler that may be wasted. | HIGH | 0.11 |
| QQQ | **`sanitize.ts` middleware not verified as wired** — XSS protection middleware exists but may not be applied globally. | MEDIUM | 0.34 |
| RRR | **`aiUsageLimit.ts` middleware not verified as wired** — AI usage limits may be unenforced or incorrectly blocking. | MEDIUM | 7.8 |
| SSS | **`cache.ts` middleware Redis-off degradation unknown** — may error or silently fail when `REDIS_ENABLED=false`. | LOW | 13.20 |
| TTT | **SocialMediaDashboard.tsx fake posting UI** — functional-looking Post buttons for 4 platforms that do nothing (same class as IntegrationsHub). | MEDIUM | 10.6e |
| UUU | **ComplianceSettings.tsx (593 lines) never audited** — GDPR/CAN-SPAM/DND toggles may not save to any backend endpoint. | MEDIUM | 10.6f |
| VVV | **5 additional String→enum candidates missed** — `CampaignLead.status`, `Call.status`, `Call.direction`, `AIInsight.type`, `AIInsight.priority`. | MEDIUM | 1.5 |
| WWW | **E2E test quality unknown** — 15 Playwright specs may be navigation smoke tests (screenshot-only), not real functional tests. | MEDIUM | 13.19 |
| XXX | **Duplicate `e2e/e2e/screenshots/` directory** — screenshots committed in two nested locations. | LOW | 12.10 |
| YYY | **`webhook.routes.ts` inline logic** — has no controller; needs extraction alongside billing/export/segmentation. | LOW | 13.4 |
| ZZZ | **Chunk load error handling missing** — all 93 `React.lazy()` pages show permanent spinner if chunk download fails. | MEDIUM | 11.18 |
| AAAA | ✅ **`GettingStarted.tsx` audited** — existing 3-step card wizard retained on Dashboard; new `OnboardingTour` added as full-site walkthrough overlay. | LOW | 15.0 |
| BBBB | **`CORS_ORIGIN` inconsistency extends beyond socket.ts** — server.ts CORS config also needs audit. | LOW | 0.35 |
| CCCC | **`nodemon` unused in backend** — devDependency installed but `tsx watch` is used instead. | LOW | 12.7 |
| DDDD | **`MockModeBanner.tsx` + `AnalyticsEmptyState.tsx` may be dead** — after mock data removal (12.5), these components need cleanup too. | LOW | 12.5 |

| 17 | Deferred + Enterprise | TBD | — |

> **Note:** ~51 days accounts for decision session time (~1 day total spread across phases) and efficiency gains from parallelizing tasks. Decision sessions for phases 1–8 are lightweight (15–30 min each, included in phase estimates). DS-1 (security) and DS-11 (admin/billing) are the heaviest at ~2 hours each and have their own half-day budget.
>
> **Parallelization opportunity:** If two people work simultaneously (e.g., one on frontend Phase 11 while another does backend Phase 13), calendar time drops to ~35–40 days.

## AUDIT CHANGELOG

**March 10, 2026 (v36) — Phase 16 partial (1/7 tasks, 6 deferred):**

- **DS-16 resolved** — Only 16.1 (CI pipeline) needed now; 16.2–16.7 (Dockerfiles, docker-compose, CSRF, request size limits, developer docs) deferred until ready for deployment
- **16.1** — Created `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: GitHub Actions CI pipeline with 3 jobs:
  - **Frontend job**: npm ci → lint → tsc + vite build (every push)
  - **Backend job**: npm ci → prisma generate → prisma migrate deploy → tsc build, with Postgres 16 + Redis 7 services (every push)
  - **E2E job**: Full stack startup + Playwright chromium tests, only on PRs to main. Uploads report artifact on failure
  - Node 22, concurrency groups with cancel-in-progress, proper health checks on services

**March 10, 2026 (v35) — Phase 15 complete (7/7 tasks):**

- **DS-15 resolved** — All 4 decisions made: full site walkthrough tour, sounds ON by default with per-event settings, Coming Soon illustration+blurred preview hybrid, CI/CD lint+typecheck+build on push with E2E on PRs to main only
- **15.0** — Audited `GettingStarted.tsx`: functional 3-step card wizard on Dashboard, retained alongside new tour
- **15.1 + 15.3** — Built `OnboardingTour.tsx`: 10-step full site walkthrough with spotlight overlay, step-by-step navigation, progress dots, back/next/skip controls. Auto-shows for new users, persists progress per-user via `userStorage`
- **15.2** — Added "Show Getting Started Tour" button in SettingsHub quick actions, triggers tour overlay on demand
- **15.4** — Built `notificationSounds.ts`: Web Audio API tone generator with unique sounds per event type. Sound settings card added to NotificationSettings with master toggle, volume slider, per-event checkboxes, and preview play buttons. Sounds trigger on real-time Socket.io notifications via `NotificationBell`
- **15.5** — Added recent search history to `GlobalSearchModal`: stores last 8 searches per-user, shows on modal open, click to re-search, clear all button
- **15.6** — Built `ComingSoon.tsx` shared component: illustration + blurred preview hybrid with "Notify Me" button. Updated `VideoTutorialLibrary`, `SocialMediaDashboard`, `NewsletterManagement`, `PhoneCampaigns`, `CampaignsList` to use standardized component
- Updated `userStorage.ts` with 4 new user-scoped keys
- Finding AAAA resolved — GettingStarted.tsx audited and new tour built alongside it

*New files:* `OnboardingTour.tsx`, `notificationSounds.ts`, `ComingSoon.tsx`
*Modified files:* `MainLayout.tsx`, `NotificationBell.tsx`, `GlobalSearchModal.tsx`, `NotificationSettings.tsx`, `SettingsHub.tsx`, `userStorage.ts`, `VideoTutorialLibrary.tsx`, `SocialMediaDashboard.tsx`, `NewsletterManagement.tsx`, `PhoneCampaigns.tsx`, `CampaignsList.tsx`

**March 2, 2026 (v5) — Cross-audit: 15 additional gaps, decision sessions system, Phase 3 split, ~51 days:**

*Cross-audit methodology:*
- Compared every plan item against actual codebase files to find gaps
- Audited all middleware files (`sanitize.ts`, `aiUsageLimit.ts`, `cache.ts`) for wiring status
- Verified Express version (5.1.0) and its implications for error handling patterns
- Audited all Prisma String fields against the enum conversion list
- Checked frontend lazy-loading error resilience
- Reviewed all 15 e2e test specs for quality/coverage
- Identified unused devDependencies (`nodemon`)
- Verified CORS config consistency across both socket.ts and server.ts

*15 new gaps found and integrated:*
- **Phase 0** (Security): +3 items — build gate check (0.0), sanitize middleware verification (0.34), CORS consistency in server.ts (0.35)
- **Phase 0.11** updated — Express 5 asyncHandler decision point added (may save 2 hours)
- **Phase 1.5** updated — 5 additional String→enum fields: `CampaignLead.status`, `Call.status`, `Call.direction`, `AIInsight.type`, `AIInsight.priority`
- **Phase 3** split into 3A (core pipeline) + 3B (import/merge/automation) with checkpoint
- **Phase 7** (AI): +1 item — aiUsageLimit middleware verification (7.8)
- **Phase 10** (Broken Pages): +2 items — SocialMediaDashboard fake UI (10.6e), ComplianceSettings audit (10.6f)
- **Phase 11** (UX): +1 item — chunk load error handling for React.lazy (11.18)
- **Phase 12.5** updated — includes MockModeBanner + AnalyticsEmptyState cleanup
- **Phase 12.7** updated — added `nodemon` to unused deps removal list
- **Phase 12.10** updated — noted duplicate `e2e/e2e/screenshots/` directory
- **Phase 13** (Quality): +3 items — e2e test quality audit (13.19), cache middleware Redis-off check (13.20), webhook controller extraction added to 13.4
- **Phase 15** (Onboarding): +1 item — GettingStarted.tsx audit before building (15.0)

*Structural changes:*
- **Decision Sessions system** — 76 decision points batched into 15 focused sessions (DS-1 through DS-15), resolved per-phase before work begins. Eliminates start-stop friction.
- **Phase 3 split** — Lead Management divided into 3A (core pipeline: follow-ups, calls, pipelines, filters) and 3B (import, merge, automation, dedup) with a review checkpoint between them. Reduces risk of the longest phase losing momentum.
- **Decision session time** budgeted in timeline (~1 day total)

*Timeline impact:* ~50 days → ~51 days (+1 day for decision sessions + new items)

---

**March 2, 2026 (v4) — Full codebase audit: 52 gaps integrated, new Phase 16, ~50 days:**

*Full-codebase audit methodology:*
- Deep read of Prisma schema, server.ts, all middleware, all routes, all frontend pages
- Grep for TODO/FIXME/HACK, console.log, window.confirm, hardcoded URLs, empty catch blocks, setTimeout leaks, localStorage usage
- Reviewed every page for fake/hardcoded data, dead buttons, missing functionality
- Audited all config files: package.json (both), tsconfig (both), .gitignore (both), .env, devcontainer, vite, eslint, tailwind
- Checked for CI/CD, deployment configs, README, developer docs

*52 gaps found and integrated:*
- **Phase 0** (Security): +11 items — Stripe raw body, graceful shutdown, distributed cron lock, auth error hardening, hardcoded fallback values, unauthenticated endpoints, AI availability hook bypass, admin rate limiter, payload error handling
- **Phase 1** (Schema): +4 items — 7 additional models missing organizationId, 5 additional indexes, Lead.assignedToId onDelete, Team vs Organization confusion
- **Phase 6** (Auth): +4 items — Remember me, 4 SecuritySettings features, double-layout fix, dual token storage
- **Phase 9** (Admin/Billing): +7 items — 4 fake help pages, HelpCenter search, PaymentMethods writes, InvoiceDetail fake data, missing Stripe methods
- **Phase 10** (Broken Pages): +3 items — APIIntegrationsPage fake, feature flags in localStorage, email template settings in localStorage
- **Phase 11** (UX): +2 items — sidebar nav gaps, dashboard chart gap
- **Phase 12** (Hygiene): +5 items — additional unused deps, Prisma backups, start-dev.sh fix, .prettierrc, devcontainer Node version, README.md
- **Phase 13** (Quality): +4 items — package.json scripts, tsconfig tests fix, Playwright config, backend scripts conversion
- **Phase 16** (NEW): +7 items — CI/CD pipeline, Dockerfiles, docker-compose, CSRF protection, request size limits, developer docs

*Timeline impact:* ~46 days → ~50 days (+4 days)

---

**March 2, 2026 (v3) — Cleanup moved to end, .md files consolidated, decision points marked:**

*Changes in this revision:*
- Moved Phase 0 (Codebase Hygiene) → Phase 12 (near end of polish section). User philosophy: build first, clean up last.
- Changed task 0.1 "Delete 144 root .md files" → "Consolidate into organized summary files." These files document the project timeline and how decisions evolved — they should be preserved in a condensed form, not deleted.
- Added ⚠️ decision markers to 59 tasks across all phases. Every marked task requires user input before work begins. This prevents skipping over design decisions.
- Added Decision Point Summary table at top of plan for quick reference.
- Renumbered all phases: old Phase 1 (Security) → new Phase 0, old Phase 2 (Data) → new Phase 1, etc.
- Updated all cross-references in Additional Findings table to match new numbering.

---

**March 2, 2026 (v2) — Reordered: build first, polish last:**

*Reordering rationale:*
- Build all features first so we can see what we have
- Keep all routes/pages/buttons during building — shows what exists and avoids premature removal
- Consolidate overlapping pages AFTER everything is built
- UX polish, accessibility, mobile optimization, onboarding, and code quality come at the end
- Admin/Team/Billing/Subscription stays near the end — design decisions still pending

*Tasks moved:*
- `window.confirm()` replacement → UX polish phase
- Feature Wiring → build early
- Lead Management, Campaigns, Analytics, Auth, AI, Telephony → feature-building phases
- Broken pages + consolidation, UX, Code Quality, Accessibility, Onboarding → polish phases
- JWT refresh → auth features phase

---

**March 2, 2026 (v1) — Admin/Team/Billing/Subscription deferral:**

*Deferred (decisions pending):*
- Help pages, SystemSettings model, ServiceConfiguration wiring, SystemSettings wiring
- BillingPage fixes, billing page consolidation, billing controller extraction
- Team invite emails, BusinessSettings ownership fix
- Admin audit trail, data backup & restore, subscription tier sync, `createdById` audit trails

---

**March 1, 2026 — Post-audit revision:**

*Removed (already done):*
- Newsletter "Coming Soon" banner, HealthCheckDashboard wiring, AI SSE streaming, Loading skeleton creation

*Removed (unnecessary work):*
- Help Center rebuild, Support Ticket System build, Video Tutorial Library
