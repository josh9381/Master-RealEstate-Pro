## **✅ OVERALL VERDICT:**

Your 730-feature list is **90% solid features**. The problem isn't the features themselves—it's trying to build them all before launch.

**Recommended approach:**
1. Save this roadmap ✅
2. Build Phase 1 only (50-75 features)
3. Launch and get users
4. Let USER FEEDBACK guide what to build next
5. Add features from this list as users request them

**This is a 5-year product roadmap, not a launch checklist.** 🚀
