3. Add loading states
4. Implement error handling
5. Add authentication flows
6. Build dashboard with real analytics data

## 💡 **Key Technical Decisions**

1. **Database:** Started with SQLite for local development (easy to switch to PostgreSQL)
2. **Auth:** JWT tokens (access + refresh pattern)
3. **Validation:** Zod schemas for type-safe validation
4. **Testing:** Jest with isolated test database
5. **Error Handling:** Centralized error handler with custom error classes
6. **API Design:** RESTful with consistent response format
7. **Middleware:** Layered approach (auth → validation → controller)
