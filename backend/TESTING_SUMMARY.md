## Running Tests

### Run All Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Run Tests with Coverage
```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Run Specific Test Suite
```bash
npm test -- auth.test.ts
npm test -- middleware.test.ts
npm test -- lead.test.ts
```

### Watch Mode
```bash
npm test -- --watch
```

---

## Test Configuration

- **Framework:** Jest
- **HTTP Testing:** Supertest
- **Database:** SQLite (test.db)
- **Coverage Tool:** Istanbul (via Jest)
- **Test Timeout:** 30 seconds

### Environment Setup
- Tests use separate test database (`test.db`)
- Database is recreated for each test suite
- Migrations applied automatically
- Each test gets isolated transactions

---

## Notes

### SQLite Compatibility
- Removed `mode: 'insensitive'` from search queries (SQLite doesn't support it)
- SQLite is case-insensitive by default for text searches
- For production PostgreSQL, add back `mode: 'insensitive'`

### Test Data Isolation
- Each test creates its own user with unique email (timestamp-based)
- Leads created with unique emails to avoid conflicts
- Database cleared between test suites

### Known Limitations
- Branch coverage at 49.44% (some error paths not tested)
- Need more edge case testing for complex queries
- Bulk operations could use more comprehensive tests

---

## Next Steps

### Recommended Test Additions
1. **Error Handling Tests**
   - Test database connection failures
   - Test invalid data types
   - Test authorization edge cases

2. **Performance Tests**
   - Large dataset pagination
   - Bulk operations with many records
   - Concurrent request handling

3. **Integration Tests**
   - Full user workflows
   - Multi-step operations
   - Related entity operations (tags, notes, activities)

4. **Future Features**
   - Tag management tests
   - Notes tests
   - Campaign tests
   - Activity logging tests
   - Task management tests
   - Dashboard analytics tests

## Continuous Integration

All tests must pass before merging to main:
```bash
# Pre-commit checks
npm test
npm run build
npm run lint
```
