- Includes actions array
- All workflow data present

#### Step 5: Update Workflow API ✅
- PUT /api/workflows/:id modifies workflow
- Name updates successfully

#### Step 6: Toggle Workflow Status ✅

- Toggle back to inactive works
- Status persists correctly

#### Step 7: Workflow Executions API ✅
- GET /api/workflows/:id/executions returns array

- Filter by isActive status works
- Query parameters properly parsed

#### Step 10: Delete Workflow ✅
- DELETE /api/workflows/:id returns success message
