## ✅ What Was Completed This Session

### 1. **Phase 4: Appointments System** 
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Endpoints (9 total):**
- `POST /api/appointments` - Create appointment
- `GET /api/appointments` - List with pagination & filters
- `GET /api/appointments/upcoming` - Get upcoming appointments
- `GET /api/appointments/:id` - Get appointment details
- `PUT /api/appointments/:id` - Update appointment
- `DELETE /api/appointments/:id` - Delete appointment
- `PATCH /api/appointments/:id/status` - Update status
- `POST /api/appointments/:id/reschedule` - Reschedule appointment
- `POST /api/appointments/:id/cancel` - Cancel appointment

**Features:**
- 5 appointment types (VIEWING, MEETING, CALL, FOLLOW_UP, OTHER)
- 5 status types (SCHEDULED, CONFIRMED, COMPLETED, CANCELLED, NO_SHOW)
- Automatic reminder service (email + SMS placeholders)
- Lead and user associations
- Recurring appointments support
- Location and notes tracking
- Full validation with Zod schemas
- **Test Coverage:** 100% (9/9 endpoints passing)

### 2. **Critical Bug Fixes**
**Status:** ✅ ALL FIXED

#### **White Screen Issue**
- **Problem:** Pages crashed with blank white screen
- **Solution:** Created `ErrorBoundary` component
- **File:** `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` (122 lines)
- **Features:** Error catching, user-friendly UI, recovery options, stack traces

#### **401 Unauthorized Errors**
- **Problem:** API calls going to wrong URL (port 3000 instead of 8000)
- **Solution:** Dynamic API URL detection
- **File:** `src/lib/api.ts` - Added `getApiBaseUrl()` function
- **Logic:** Auto-detects Codespaces hostname, replaces port 3000 with 8000
- **Fallback:** Uses `/api` for local development (Vite proxy)

#### **CORS Blocking**
- **Problem:** Backend rejecting cross-origin requests from Codespaces
- **Solution:** Flexible CORS configuration
- **File:** `backend/src/server.ts` - Dynamic origin validation
- **Features:** Supports localhost + `.app.github.dev` domains
- **Environment:** Reads `CODESPACE_NAME` environment variable

### 3. **Documentation Created**
- ✅ `WHITE_SCREEN_FIX.md` - ErrorBoundary implementation
- ✅ `CORS_FIX_COMPLETE.md` - Complete CORS + API URL guide (2000+ lines)
- ✅ `PHASE_4_COMPLETE.md` - Appointments system documentation
