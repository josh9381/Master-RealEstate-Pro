## Edge Cases

### Very Long Messages
**Limit:** 500 tokens (~2000 characters)

If your message is too long:
1. Split into multiple sections
2. Enhance each section separately
3. Combine manually after

**Or:** Shorten original message first, then enhance

---

### Non-English Text
The enhancer works best with English. For other languages:
- Results may vary in quality
- Consider using a translation service first
- Test with small samples

---

### Special Formatting
The AI preserves:
- Paragraph breaks
- Lists (bullet points, numbers)
- Basic structure

May not preserve:
- HTML tags
- Complex formatting
- Custom styling

**Tip:** Add formatting after enhancement

---

### Merge Fields
If using merge fields like `{{firstName}}`:

**Original:**
```
Hello {{firstName}}, check out our listings!
```

**Enhanced (Professional):**
```
Dear {{firstName}}, we invite you to explore our curated 
selection of premium properties.
```

The AI preserves merge fields! ✅
