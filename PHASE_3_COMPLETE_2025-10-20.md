## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management

**Activity Timeline:**
```typescript
const [filter, setFilter] = useState<'all' | 'email' | 'call' | 'sms' | 'note'>('all')
const [expandedIds, setExpandedIds] = useState<number[]>([])
```

**Follow-ups:**
```typescript
const [view, setView] = useState<'queue' | 'calendar'>('queue')
const [filter, setFilter] = useState<'all' | 'overdue' | 'today' | 'week'>('all')
const [followups, setFollowups] = useState<FollowUp[]>(mockFollowups)
const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState('')
```

### Event Handlers

**Activity Timeline:**
- `toggleExpanded(id)` - Expand/collapse activity details
- `setFilter(type)` - Filter by activity type

**Follow-ups:**
- `handleComplete(id)` - Mark follow-up as complete
- `setFilter(type)` - Filter by time range/status
- `setView(mode)` - Switch between queue/calendar (future)
- Search input onChange - Real-time filtering

### Toast Integration
```typescript
// Activity completion
toast.success(`Follow-up with ${lead.name} marked as complete`)

// Other actions (future)
toast.success('Follow-up scheduled successfully')
toast.error('Failed to update follow-up')
```

### TypeScript Types
```typescript
interface Activity {
  id: number
  type: 'email' | 'call' | 'sms' | 'note' | 'status' | 'meeting' | 'task'
  title: string
  description: string
  date: string
  timestamp: string
  author?: string
  details?: {
    subject?: string
    duration?: string
    outcome?: string
    emailOpened?: boolean
    emailClicked?: boolean
    attachments?: number
    tags?: string[]
  }
}

interface FollowUp {
  id: number
  lead: string
  company: string
  type: 'call' | 'email' | 'meeting' | 'task'
  date: string
  time: string
  priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
  status: 'pending' | 'completed' | 'overdue'
  notes?: string
}
```
